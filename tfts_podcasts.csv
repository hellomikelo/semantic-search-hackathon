0,Listen Up: Why It’s Better to Be Interested than Interesting,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/listen-why-its-better-be-interested-interesting,"In this episode, Alison Wood Brooks reveals the secret to having better conversations. As a communication expert, Alison Wood Brooks spends a lot of time talking about talking. But, as she says, listening is just as important. “My course is called TALK,” says Brooks, who is the O’Brien Associate Professor of Business Administration and Hellman Faculty Fellow at Harvard Business School. “The great irony is that it should really be called LISTEN. It’s hard to be a good listener yet so very important.” In the latest episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Brooks covers conversation strategies for active listening, turning anxiety into excitement, and knowing when it’s time to change the subject.",
1,Quick Thinks: Talk It Out – How to Successfully Negotiate and Resolve Conflict,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/quick-thinks-talk-it-out-how-successfully-negotiate-resolve-conflict,"Professor Michele Gelfand shares communication strategies for getting more of what you want. When it comes to negotiating and managing conflict, Michele Gelfand, professor of organizational behavior, says it’s time to get creative. Everybody has wants and needs. So what do we do when our priorities compete with those of other people? According to Gelfand, negotiations and conflict management are exercises in creative problem-solving, ones where we look for ways to not only get what we want, but for those on the other side of the table to get what they want too. “The best negotiators tend to be the most creative,” says Gelfand. Listen as Gelfand joins Matt Abrahams to discuss how creative communication can help us find solutions where everybody wins.",
2,Strategic Success: How to Communicate Your Gameplan,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/strategic-success-how-communicate-your-gameplan,"In this episode, Jesper Sørensen explores why organizational strategy can be both top-down and bottom-up. As Professor Jesper Sørensen sees it, a winning strategy is the result of conversations, not commands. Sørensen says strategy can be directed from the C-suite, but it doesn’t have to be. “Lots of great strategies are discovered,” he says, “they’re discovered because the leaders were able to listen to their frontline workers or their frontline managers.” A more iterative approach, says Sørensen, helps companies adapt their strategy to an ever-changing landscape. In the latest episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Sørensen joins host and lecturer Matt Abrahams to discuss how organizations can use better communication to craft better strategies.",
3,Keep ’Em Coming: Why Your First Ideas Aren’t Always the Best,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/keep-em-coming-why-your-first-ideas-arent-always-best,"In this episode, Jeremy Utley explains why good ideas are often preceded by not-so-good ideas. What’s the secret to coming up with good ideas? For Jeremy Utley, it’s about generating as many as possible. The director of executive education at the Stanford d.school, Utley says, “very few problems we face in business or in life have a single right answer.” All ideas — the good, the bad, and the ugly — are “a necessary input to an innovation process,” and an essential step in getting to solutions that will actually work. In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Utley and host Matt Abrahams explore how we can focus less on finding the “right” answer and open ourselves up to more innovative ideas.",
4,Feeling Nervous? How Anxiety Can Fuel Better Communication,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/feeling-nervous-how-anxiety-can-fuel-better-communication,"In this episode, lecturer Kelly McGonigal shares how stress and anxiety can be used to enhance our communication. Stress, anxiety, nervousness — when these feelings inevitably arise, lecturer Kelly McGonigal says it’s not about making them go away, but using them to your advantage. “What I have come to value about anxiety,” says McGonigal, “is it’s a sign that I care.” As she explains, feelings of stress alert us to things that matter to us and help us stay present in the moment — particularly useful, she says, when it comes to communication. In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, McGonigal and host Matt Abrahams discuss how to channel stress toward more effective communication and a deeper connection to our own purpose and meaning.",
5,Directive Speech vs. Dialogue: Communicating Better as a Leader,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/directive-speech-vs-dialogue-communicating-better-leader,"In this episode, Dean Jon Levin shares his thoughts on the changing role of communication in business leadership. As the dean of Stanford Graduate School of Business, Dean Jon Levin knows the importance of crafting the right message and sharing it in the right way. But, as he says, one of the biggest challenges for any leader is to know what to communicate, and how. How do leaders strike the balance between being clear and directive, while, as Levin says, “leaving space for people to form their own opinions, to discuss ideas, to debate?” He joins host and lecturer of strategic communications Matt Abrahams to discuss on this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart.",
6,What Is Normal? How Culture Affects Communication Styles,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/what-normal-how-culture-affects-communication-styles,"In this episode, Michele Gelfand explains why social norms are the glue that keeps cultures together. Why do we drive on only one side of the road? Why don’t we sing in libraries? Why wear a swimsuit? For Professor Michele Gelfand, it all comes down to culture. As a cross-cultural psychologist, Gelfand is fascinated by social environments and their effects on human behavior, particularly, how strictly people adhere to social norms. In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Gelfand joins host and lecturer of strategic communications Matt Abrahams to explain why some cultures are “tight” and “have strict social norms,” while others are “loose,” with “more permissibility of behavior.”",
7,Ties That Bind: Why Remote Teams Need the Right Connection,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/ties-bind-why-remote-teams-need-right-connection,"In this episode, Professor Glenn Carroll and his colleague Michael Arena discuss innovation in a hybrid work environment. “We need to be much more adaptive in the way we think about hybrid work. Experiment, experiment, experiment.” Innovation relies on teams connecting in very specific ways. But are those connections possible in a hybrid work reality? Glenn Carroll, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford GSB, and Michael Arena, faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania, have been looking for the answer — studying how team interactions have changed since millions of workers went remote. In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, they discuss how teams can optimize their communications to keep innovating in a post-pandemic world.",
8,The Price of Cheap Talk: What Economics Teaches Us About Communication,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/price-cheap-talk-what-economics-teaches-us-about-communication,"In this episode, we explore how economic concepts show up in everyday communication. Are your words credible? Or are they what Paul Oyer calls “cheap talk”? According to Oyer, a professor of economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business, how our words align with our actions isn’t just a matter of communication, but a matter of economics too. Economic concepts hold in all areas of life, which Oyer’s research has explored in everything from Uber driving and online dating to most recently, sports. “Economics is everywhere,” Oyer says. “It’s an incredibly powerful lens to analyze almost anything in the real world.”",

All communication comes from a place of creativity, and creativity is rooted in design. In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, strategic communications lecturer and podcast host Matt Abrahams interviews four authors from the Stanford d.school. Each conversation challenges conventional approaches to communication, whether visual, physical, or verbal.

10,"Communicating Uncertainty: How to Connect With Your Audience, Even When The Answers Aren’t Clear ",https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/communicating-uncertainty-how-connect-your-audience-even-when-answers-arent-clear,"In this podcast episode, we discuss how being transparent is crucial to earning trust. “It’s not reassuring when we don’t know the answers to critically important questions involved in health and wellbeing. But it’s far more of a problem if we try to pretend we do.” In this episode of& Think Fast, Talk Smart, Stanford Medical School dean Lloyd Minor sits down with podcast host Matt Abrahams to discuss transparency in leadership. “Rather than pushing ambiguity away, we should lean into it, and use it as a stimulus to guide our communication in more effective ways.” They also discuss the benefits an introvert can bring to leadership roles and critical role listening plays for anyone in a position of power.",
11,From Dreaming to Doing: How We Set and Achieve Goals,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/dreaming-doing-how-we-set-achieve-goals,"In this episode, we look at an essential ingredient of human behavior: motivation. Why do we do what we do? What factors drive us? And how do things like competition with others help us achieve our goals? These are the questions most interesting to Szu-chi Huang, an associate professor of marketing with a specific interest in motivation. “Competition definitely increases motivation,” says Huang. “It makes attaining the goal more valuable.” In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Huang and host Matt Abrahams explore the intersection of human psychology, behavior, and goal attainment — and how communication connects them all.",
12,Forgiveness: How the Right Communication Repairs Relationships,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/forgiveness-how-right-communication-repairs-relationships,"In this podcast episode, we look at the role of forgiveness in healthy communication. When it comes to communication and relationships, mistakes are inevitable. And when we find ourselves with damaged connections, it’s a specific kind of communication that can help us make amends. Fred Luskin is the director of the Stanford University Forgiveness Project, and has devoted much of his career to researching the way forgiveness affects our psychological, relational, and physical health. “Apology is one of the few things that research shows actually facilitates forgiveness,” Luskin explains. In this Think Fast, Talk Smart episode with host and strategic communication lecturer Matt Abrahams, Luskin outlines what it means to truly say we’re sorry.",

Together with host Matt Abrahams, Hansen shares how, from our workplaces to our personal lives, communication thrives when we cultivate open-mindedness, intellectual humility, and genuine curiosity.",
14,Lean Messaging: How Simple Messages Really Stick,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/lean-messaging-how-simple-messages-really-stick,"In this podcast episode, a veteran marketer and entrepreneur shares his approach to communicating for startup success. “Anyone can make a complicated thing sound complicated. It takes real skill to make it sound simple.” This episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart features Steve Blank, a seasoned entrepreneur, marketer, and adjunct professor in Stanford’s department of Management Science and Engineering. Blank teaches courses on lean startups, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Throughout his 45 years of launching businesses and helping others do the same, he’s learned the importance of crafting the perfect message by not making it complicated. “Messages need to be memorable,” he tells podcast host and strategic communications lecturer Matt Abrahams. “The more memorable the message, the greater its ability to create change.”",

And you kind of have to get out of your own way to effectively design with others’ needs in mind.” In this podcast episode, Lecturer of Strategic Communications Matt Abrahams is joined by Sarah Stein Greenberg, Director of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, aka the Stanford d.school, and author of Creative Acts for Curious People: How to Think, Create, and Lead in Unconventional Ways.

16,Leadership and Ethics: How to Communicate Your Core Values,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/leadership-ethics-how-communicate-your-core-values,"On this podcast episode, we discuss the keys to making ethical decisions in your professional and personal life. “A mistake that some leaders make is to assume that the people in your organization share your core values. Some of the time some of them do, but there’s a bunch who don’t, and those are the most difficult sorts of situations.” In this podcast episode, political science professors Ken Shotts and Neil Malhotra sit down with host and lecturer Matt Abrahams to discuss how to lead others whose values may not align with your own. “The most effective thing you can do is to understand the other person’s story and frame the language and arguments around them… It’s fundamentally about being empathetic.”",
17,Leading From Home: How to Create the Right Environment for Communication,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/leading-home-how-create-right-environment-communication,"In this podcast episode, we discuss the importance of not just knowing what your audience needs to hear, but how they need to hear it. “You’re not going to hit the mark with everybody, but you still need to be mindful of everybody,” says Jonathan Levav, a professor of marketing at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “That’s critical to create an environment where communication is effective.” In this podcast episode, Levav sits down with podcast host Matt Abrahams to talk about how to lead from home and how to foster an environment for creativity, innovation, and collaboration.

In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, host Matt Abrahams sits down with finance professors Jonathan Berk of Stanford Graduate School of Business and Jules van Binsbergen of The Wharton School to discuss common flaws in the decision-making process, and what to do about them. “When you make a decision, you have to take into account the effect of that decision on the world. Too often, people ignore that,” says Berk. “They engage in what I would call ‘All Else Equal’ thinking, and they evaluate the effect of the decision — holding everything else the same. You can never do that. I know it sounds obvious as I talk about it, but you’d be surprised how often people get fooled.” Berk and van Binsbergen explore the topic of decision-making in-depth with business leaders in their new podcast, All Else Equal: Making Better Decisions.",

In this interview with podcast host Matt Abrahams, Heath talks about ways that data and statistics can be used to illuminate — or obscure — our message. “A lot of people in the world don’t understand numbers like the numbers people,” he says. “And there are a lot of untranslated numbers that float around in organizations and in society.” Heath suggests thinking about numbers like a foreign language we need to “translate” for our audience: “If we don’t translate numbers into something that’s more tangible, we’re going to sacrifice in a big way.”",

Zenios is the director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and heads Startup Garage, a project-based course where teams design and test business concepts that address real-world problems. “Founders have to tell a story to their customers so that they can inspire them to test and use their new product. They have to tell a story to their employees to inspire them to take some risk. And then, they have to tell a story to investors and their board.”",

That’s the definition that we use in creativity research,” says Justin Berg, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business.

25,Step Into Power: What Acting Can Teach Us About Power and Responsibility ,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/step-power-what-acting-can-teach-us-about-power-responsibility,"In this podcast episode, we discuss how lessons from the theater inform leadership styles and power dynamics at work. “Leadership is a role that you play, like a part you play in other people’s lives. And [your] expression of that role is your responsibility as a leader,” says Stanford GSB lecturer Melissa Jones Briggs. Jones Briggs’ work combines techniques from the theater with social science research to teach lessons about power and communication. In this conversation with podcast host Matt Abrahams, she discusses how acting in a leadership position requires staying present and also knowing when to step back. “Power and authority often determine which stories are centered and which stories are marginalized,” Jones Briggs says. “By uncovering previously untold stories, we can create environments that invite new stories in, and that helps shape inclusive and equitable work cultures.”",

27,"Space, Pace, and Grace: How to Handle Challenging Conversations",https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/space-pace-grace-how-handle-challenging-conversations,"In this podcast episode, we discuss the power of slowing down during difficult workplace situations. Being a better listener has a lot to do with silence, says Collins Dobbs, a lecturer in management at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “A lot of people are uncomfortable with the smallest modicum of silence, but learning often happens when we create distance for useful reflection.” In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, Dobbs talks with host Matt Abrahams about the importance of “space, pace, and grace” when you’re receiving others’ feedback and handling the emotions that come out during tough discussions. “There’s often a lot more focus on the skill set on delivering emotion than receiving emotion, but if the receiver of emotion can put themselves in a place of curiosity, agency, and openness… opens up a whole new world of possibilities.” Dobbs is an executive coach and teaches several courses, including Interpersonal Dynamics and Leadership Labs.",

30,Brains Love Stories: How Leveraging Neuroscience Can Capture People’s Emotions  ,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/brains-love-stories-how-leveraging-neuroscience-can-capture-peoples-emotions,"In this podcast episode, we learn about ways to tap into our hardwired response to communication. In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, lecturer and podcast host Matt Abrahams sits down with David Eagleman, a neuroscientist and the host of the PBS series The Brain, to discuss why our brains are wired for storytelling and how new senses might impact our connection and communication with others. “I’ve always been really interested in this idea of how we can pass information to the brain via unusual channels,” Eagleman says. “We’ve got our eyes or ears or fingertips and our nose, we’re very used to this and we sort of think these are fundamental, but of course, this is just what we’ve inherited from a long road of evolution … It turns out you can push information in the brain in other ways.”",
31,The New Normal: How Hybrid Work Actually Works ,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/new-normal-how-hybrid-work-actually-works,"In this podcast episode, we discuss the effectiveness of communicating in a hybrid work environment. “One of the things I think is really exciting about all this, and perhaps a little bit frightening, is nobody actually knows how to do it. It is not something that we’ve ever done before. And I’ve studied a lot of globally distributed work, and virtual teams, and so forth. But hybrid work is not that and it’s not telecommuting, which we know a bit about. But it’s something that is a mix of these multiple different modes of working,” says Pamela Hinds, Fortinet Founders Chair and professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University. In this podcast episode, Hinds talks with host and lecturer Matt Abrahams about her research on the effect of technology on teams, teamwork, and innovation by exploring issues of culture, language, identity, and conflict in promoting knowledge sharing and collaboration. “Employees are going to expect flexibility. Organizations are going to need to sustain a higher level of flexibility with regard to when and where people work.”",

He also talks about his new book The Brains and Brawn Company: How Leading Organizations Blend the Best of Digital and Physical. “Being a great communicator is critical in your written communication [and] in your verbal communication in a world that’s increasingly connected,” Siegel says. “Because there’s so much input for everybody, you want to kind of control and shape the messages that get out there.”",
33,Perfecting Teamwork: Building High-Performing Teams by Encouraging Learning,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/building-high-performing-teams-encouraging-learning,"In this podcast episode, we learn how to break down professional silos and hierarchies in teams.

34,Leading from the Hot Seat: How to Communicate under Pressure,https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/leading-hot-seat-how-communicate-under-pressure,"In this podcast episode, we discuss how to communicate effectively during a crisis. “I say sometimes that leadership is a journey into yourself. It’s self-renewal, self-reflection, self-confidence. It’s going to bed kind of scratching your head and saying, ‘Man, I’m not as good,’ and waking up the next morning and trying it again — and I think that’s what matters.” In this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart, former CEO of General Electric and Stanford Graduate School of Business lecturer Jeff Immelt sits down with lecturer Matt Abrahams to discuss communicating during times of challenge and pressure. “There’s no such thing as perfection of crisis,” Immelt says. “This is a pass-fail test, and all you really want to do is make progress.”",

In this podcast episode, Huberman talks with host and lecturer Matt Abrahams about his research on the autonomic continuum, a spectrum between states of high alertness or fear all the way down to deep sleep, and shares how to use the system to your advantage. “If people can conceptualize that the anxiety or stress response is the same as the excitement response, they feel different,” Huberman says.",
